## Question:
Write a Python function transpose(m) that takes as input a two dimensional matrix m and returns the transpose of m. The argument m should remain undisturbed by the function.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work. You may assume that the input to the function is always a non-empty matrix.

>>> transpose([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
[[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]

>>> transpose([[1],[2],[3]])
[[1, 2, 3]]

>>> transpose([[3]])
[[3]]

## Question:
Define a Python function remdup(l) that takes a nonempty list of integers l and removes all duplicates in l, keeping only the first occurrence of each number. For instance:

>>> remdup([3,1,3,5])
[3, 1, 5]

>>> remdup([7,3,-1,-5])
[7, 3, -1, -5]

>>> remdup([3,5,7,5,3,7,10])
[3, 5, 7, 10]

## Demo:
 """ 
 Removes duplicates from the input list while preserving the order of the first occurrences.

    Parameters:
    l (list): Nonempty list of integers.

    Returns:
    list: List with duplicates removed, keeping only the first occurrence of each number.

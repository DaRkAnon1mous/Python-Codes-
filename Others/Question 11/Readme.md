## Question:
Write a Python function sumsquare(l) that takes a nonempty list of integers and returns a list [odd,even], where odd is the sum of squares all the odd numbers in l and even is the sum of squares of all the even numbers in l.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

>>> sumsquare([1,3,5])
[35, 0]

>>> sumsquare([2,4,6])
[0, 56]

>>> sumsquare([-1,-2,3,7])
[59, 4]
A two dimensional matrix can be represented in Python row-wise, as a list of lists: each inner list represents one row of the matrix. For instance, the matrix

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
would be represented as [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]].

The transpose of a matrix converts each row into a column. The transpose of the matrix above is:

1  5
2  6
3  7
4  8
which would be represented as [[1, 5], [2, 6], [3, 7], [4, 8]].
